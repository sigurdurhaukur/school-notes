# 6.1 Circular motion

## Usefull definitons

**uniform motion:** motion at a constant(uniform) velocity

**period (s):** 
- the time it takes to traverse "one circle" 
- time taken by object to complete one revolution on its circular path

**frequency (Hz):** "how many circles" - number of circles traversed per unit time


### Linear speed (m/s)
The linear speed is the speed of a rotating object.

the constant speed of an object travelling in a circular motion of radius $r$ and with the time taken to complete one full revolution, $T$  the **period** of the motion.

$$
v = \frac{ 2 \pi r }{T}
$$

### Angular speed (rad/s)
The angular speed is the rate at which the thing turns.

$$
\omega = \frac{\text{angle swept}}{\text{time taken}} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$
For  a full revolution, $\Delta \theta = 2 \pi r$ and $\Delta t = T$ the angular speed is:

$$
\omega = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}
$$
Since the rotating **frequency** $f$ is given by:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$
we have:

$$
w = \frac{2 \pi r}{T} = 2 \pi f
$$

### Relation between linear speed and angular speed
The relation is given by the databooklet

$$
v = r \omega
$$

the video below explains the difference very well. Basicly angular speed is how fast something changes "angles", or how fast an object rotates. Linear speed is how fast something travels as it rotates.

That's why linear speed is dependant on the radius $r$ but angular speed is dependant on the frequency $f$

$$
v = \frac{ 2 \pi r }{T}
$$

$$
\omega = \frac{\text{angle swept}}{\text{time taken}} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$
