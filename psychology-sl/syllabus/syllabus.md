## Attendance and Progress Rules for IB Courses at MH

-   The minimum acceptable attendance ratio for students in the IB programme is **85% each**  
    **semester,** both overall and in each individual course.
-   A ratio of 80-84% is a danger zone that will require explanation and interview with the DP  
    coordinator.
-   An attendance ratio of < 80% will, other things being equal, mean a **fail grade** (less than 5  
    out of 10) for the course in question and may prevent the student from continuing in the IB  
    programme.

## Academic honesty

-   Pre-IB and IB DP students are independent learners and MH emphasises their independence.  
    The school expects its IB students to strive to fit the IB learner profile by being principled  
    and acting with integrity and honesty.
-   It expects its students to exercise academic honesty and good academic practices in all their  
    work, both oral and written, whether it be produced in class, outside class, or on final  
    exams. This includes projects, assignments, homework, CAS documentation and reflections,  
    essays, research papers and creative work. Good academic practices include acknowledging  
    any sources used within an assignment, carefully citing them and including a bibliography  
    using an appropriate academic referencing system. This applies equally to sources in print,  
    online and other recorded forms.
